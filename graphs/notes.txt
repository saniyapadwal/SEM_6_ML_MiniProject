Latitude (37.7749) → Specifies how far north/south from the equator.
Longitude (-122.4194) → Specifies how far east/west from the Prime Meridian.


Longitude Range:
Western Hemisphere: 0° to -180° (e.g., USA, South America)
Eastern Hemisphere: 0° to +180° (e.g., Europe, Asia, Australia)

alpha controls the transparency of the points in the scatter plot.
Range: 0 (completely transparent) to 1 (fully visible).


 If latitude decreases as temperature increases, the regression line will slope downward (negative correlation).
This would mean hotter temperatures at lower latitudes (closer to the equator) and cooler temperatures at higher latitudes.
